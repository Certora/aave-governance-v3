voting_and_tally.spec
=====================

Questions/Comments:
------------------
1. In most of the confs we have loop_iter==1. Is it correct ?
2. When running the tests:
   - power_summary.conf has several failures (including sanity fails)
   - misc.conf has several failures and timeouts
   - proposal_states.conf has one sanity failure.
3. I checked the mutants against:
   - legality.conf
   - proposal_config.conf
   - proposal_states.conf
   - voting_and_tally.conf


Mutations:

7. DETECTED
Changed file: VotingMachineWithProofs.sol ==> VotingMachineWithProofs-7.sol
The change: VotingMachineWithProofs.sol::319 
   orig:
      return _proposals[proposalId].votes[user];
   mutant:
      return _proposals[proposalId+1].votes[user];


8. DETECTED
Changed file: VotingMachineWithProofs.sol ==> VotingMachineWithProofs-8.sol
The change: VotingMachineWithProofs.sol::250
    orig:
        Proposal storage proposal = _proposals[proposalId];
   mutant:
       Proposal storage proposal = _proposals[0];

Suggestion for rules that can catch it:

9. UNDETECTED
Changed file: VotingMachineWithProofs.sol ==> VotingMachineWithProofs-9.sol
The change: VotingMachineWithProofs.sol::288
    orig:
      proposalListLength - skip - i - 1
   mutant:
      proposalListLength - skip - i
